# Local Deployment
The local deployment of SyncFlow is a straightforward process that involves setting up the backend server, frontend dashboard and Livekit server within a local environement. This also involves setting up the necessary configurations and dependencies to ensure a seamless deployment. The local deployment is ideal for setting up `SyncFlow` in a localized environment, where access to the Internet is restricted for privacy or security reasons and also for constrained bandwidth scenarios. The deployment process is illustrated below:

For local deployment, we provide a detailed guide on setting up the deployment in a separate github repository. The repository contains the necessary configurations, scripts and instructions to set up the backend server, frontend dashboard and Livekit server. The repository can be accessed [here](https://github.com/oele-isis-vanderbilt/syncflow-local-deployment.git).
